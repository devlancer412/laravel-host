GGM & Co E-Commerce

This is a project for a client(Gregg William from Cross Country Pkwy, NY, US) who didn't pay me. As I didn't get paid, I am publishing the code here for free distribution.

The project involves laravel and bootstrap technologies, also stripe integration, pure websocket chat with ratchet module.

I of course do not encourage hackers to look at the code here including data structures and payment process to understand how to hack this site.
